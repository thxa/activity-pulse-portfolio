# Machine Learning

Welcome to my machine learning blog! Here I explore the fascinating world of AI, data science, and predictive modeling.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- **Classification**: Categorizing data into classes
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values
- **Examples**: Spam detection, house price prediction

### Unsupervised Learning
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing data complexity
- **Examples**: Customer segmentation, image compression

### Reinforcement Learning
- **Q-Learning**: Learning optimal actions
- **Policy Gradients**: Direct policy optimization
- **Examples**: Game AI, robotics control
